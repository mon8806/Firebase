# Firebase

The projext lets the user input train name and the time interval of the next train. Pretty much a schedule.

This project sends data to firebase and it get sent back, so the user doesnt always have to refresh the page. Everything is saved while new information is inputed.

User just have to fill out the info and submit, they should get when the next train is coming and how far away it is in minutes.

This project utilizes firebase, javascript and jquery.
